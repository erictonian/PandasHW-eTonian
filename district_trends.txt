Pandas School District Trends1. More than anything else, the school district data suggest that the biggest influence on both math and reading scores is school type, with students in charter schools having a significantly higher scores and passing rates than those in regular district schools. There could be a number of reasons, e.g., charter schools having admittance requirements, charter schools catering more towards standardized tests than general education, charter schools being under increased scrutiny for performance, charter schools having a lower number of students per class. With the current data set these would just be conjectures and more information is needed to really suggest a cause for this sharp divide.2. Another interesting trend is the difference in testing scores when looking at budget per student. Classically we would assume that having a higher available budget per student would lead to an increase in performance as it would allow for higher quality materials, facilities, and teachers but the data seem to suggest that the opposite is true. This could potentially be explained by the fact that most of the charter schools are on the lower end of the budget scale so it may be more helpful to look at the budget effect among district and charter schools separately.
